    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m Amara Dhanush Kumar, a Multimedia Editor and a third-year Computer Science & Engineering student at Lendi Institute of Engineering & Technology in Vizianagaram. I lead the Lendi Radio Club as President, where Iâ€™ve managed creative teams and overseen audio-visual productions for campus events.

With a passion for visual storytelling, I specialize in using tools like Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro to craft engaging content. My portfolio includes highlight reels for college fests and short-form videos under my Instagram handle @dhanush_the_versatile. Iâ€™m constantly refining my editing techniquesâ€”exploring transitions, pacing, and narrative structureâ€”to produce polished and impactful visuals.

Iâ€™m known for my attention to detail, timeliness, and adaptable approach. Outside of editing, I enjoy collaborating with peers, brainstorming creative concepts, and learning new software and techniques to stay ahead in multimedia trends.

Currently, Iâ€™m open to part-time freelance projectsâ€”from event coverage and promotional videos to social media content for local organizations. I welcome opportunities that challenge me both creatively and technically. Letâ€™s collaborate and bring your visual ideas to life.
